jay.c
=====

A very simple scanner-based JSON parser which does not use malloc.

Designed for super-simple embedded environments operating on mostly
known input, without much else to go on. This is a copylib -- include
into your own projects and compile away. Does not have any
dependencies outside of the C standard library.

Note that it currently does not support streaming -- it requires the
entire buffer to be in contiguous memory. This was good enough for
my own purposes, but for future projects I might extend this to
support partial loading and streaming of data.

Please see the included example for proper usage.

I license this work into the public domain. Do with it what you want.
